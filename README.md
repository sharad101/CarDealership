# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

The Car Dealership Application is a console-based dealership management application designed for use by sales personnel at a car dealership. 
It provides a simple interface for viewing, searching, adding, and removing vehicles from the dealership's inventory. 
Users can filter vehicles based on price, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type. The inventory is stored in a pipe-delimited file, ensuring that all changes (such as adding or removing vehicles) are saved persistently. This lightweight system is ideal for managing vehicle listings directly from a desktop environment.
